#We are interested in the distance between start and end stations, notice the Lat Lon for each station is 
#in the Stations dataset and the information about each trip is in the Trip dataset. 
#using the merge function, make new columns in the trip dataset that give the lat and lon of both the 
#start and end station. Use setnames to chang columns names where necessary

#the function distHaversine will calculate the distance between 2 sets of lat lon values. Make a new column 
#that gives the distance between the start and end points of every trip. I have provided an example of 
#one way to set up the arguments for distm below


Trips$distance<-distHaversine(Trips[,.(slon,slat)], Trips[,.(elon,elat)])

#on average, do casual or registered clients travel farther?

#From which station on average do clients travel the farthest from?

#Frequently clients rent and return bikes from the same station. What station has the highest frequency of self-returns for 
#its rentals?

#how many docks does the station with the most rentals have?
#Hint:You will need to derive the number of docks from the information available. 

#What is the average distance traveled for bikes during the time period of data collection?
